This project contains one script: run_analysis.R

This script loads Samsung data recorded in accelerometers from two datasets: test and train.  The script then cleans up the data and puts it into a tidy dataset.  The last step in the script is to create another tidy dataset that take the mean of all variables by subject/activity.
